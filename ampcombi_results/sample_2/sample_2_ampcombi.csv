Is not active against the Gram-positive Coccus species, Gram-negative non-fermentation species and against the fungus C.albicans. It leads to aggregation of bacteria as an initial step of its bactericidal mechanism. Aggregated cells are connected via electron-dense contacts and adopt a thorn apple-like morphology. Hydramycin contains a belt of positively charged residues that separate two hydrophobic areas. This structure may explain the observed aggregation of bacteria, since each of these areas can immerse into the outer leaflets of the membranes of two individual bacteria. Is able to permeabilize membranes of viable bacteria at low and neutral pH values, but no pore-forming activity is not detected.
Tissue specificity: Expressed in the endodermal epithelium.
Induction: By bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS).

The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein- effector interaction. Involved in the abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene signaling pathways. Regulates acropetal transport of auxin (IAA) in roots and hypocotyls, and thus modulates root architecture (e.g. lateral root formation). The heterotrimeric G- protein controls defense responses to necrotrophic and vascular fungi probably by modulating cell wall-related genes expression; involved in resistance to fungal pathogens such as Alternaria brassicicola, Plectosphaerella cucumerina and Fusarium oxysporum.
Tissue specificity: Mostly expressed in seedlings (especially at the hypocotyl/root junction), young cauline leaves, open flowers, and floral stems, and, to a lower extent, in roots (restricted to the stele), rosette leaves (restricted to veins), siliques, and unopened floral buds. Also present in hydathods.

In addition, this protein has an ability to induce apoptosis in cultured HeLa and K562 cells, and inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation dose-dependently. Effects of snake L-amino oxidases on platelets are controversial, since they either induce aggregation or inhibit agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions.

Is not active against the Gram-positive Coccus species, Gram-negative non-fermentation species and against the fungus C.albicans. It leads to aggregation of bacteria as an initial step of its bactericidal mechanism. Aggregated cells are connected via electron-dense contacts and adopt a thorn apple-like morphology. Hydramycin contains a belt of positively charged residues that separate two hydrophobic areas. This structure may explain the observed aggregation of bacteria, since each of these areas can immerse into the outer leaflets of the membranes of two individual bacteria. Is able to permeabilize membranes of viable bacteria at low and neutral pH values, but no pore-forming activity is not detected.
