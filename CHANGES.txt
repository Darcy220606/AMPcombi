    -- Added a universal log file, to append to an existing log file rather than creating multiple new ones every time a sample is run.
    -- The "--path_list" can be called multiple times to include a list of files from individual samples in multiple lists
v<0.1.5>, <27.10.2022> -- Initial release.
    -- adapt reading of hmmer_hmmsearch output to deal with varying header lines
    -- fix syntax in "if" statements in "check_input.py"
    -- include "check_faa_path" function, to find .faa files also in subdirectories
v<0.1.6>, <02.11.2022>
    -- Included the HTML output for the complete summary
    -- add option --threads for diamond (make database and alignment)
    -- included check if database was downloaded once to not download again
v<0.1.7>, <03.11.2022>
    -- Included the possibility of only submitting one .faa file instead of the faa-folder path (in case of summarizing only one single sample)
v<0.1.8>, <14.02.2023>
    -- Linked to Zenodo archive
v<0.1.9>, <XX.10.2023>
    -- Change the output extension from `.csv` to `.tsv`
    -- Added a new feature to estimates the isoelectric point, mwt, structure fraction and hydrophobicity
    -- The DRAMP db `.tsv` was filtered to retain only necessary columns
    -- Added the tool AMPtransformer
    -- Added the tool AMPgram
    -- Fixed hmmsearch to now parse both single and multi models
    -- Fixed the dependencies in the environment.yml file
    -- Added a log file for each sample, besides the main log for the complete summary. Beneficial when used in pipelines like nfcore/funcscan
    -- Removed tooldictionary parameter '--tooldict' and added a parameter for each tool instead '--tool_file' to assign the extension of the files per tool
    -- Added the parameter `--hmm_evalue` to filter the hmm results in table based on evalue
    -- Added the parameter `--aminoacid_length` to retain hits with a specific length
    -- Added the paarmeter `db_evalue` to filter out classification hits below specific diamond evalues
    -- Renamed the parameter `--cutoff` to `--amp_cutoff`
    -- Added the parameter '--gbk' to add gbk files as input for parsing to add contig ids and other important values
    -- Added the parameter '--window_size_stop_codon' that adjusts the window size to look for stop codons
    -- Added the parameter '--remove_stop_codons' that removes hits with no stop codons found in teh vicinity
    -- Added the parameter '--window_size_transporter' that adjusts the window size to look for 'transporter' proteins
    -- Added a new output dir per sample that holds the gbk files for the contigs with hits
